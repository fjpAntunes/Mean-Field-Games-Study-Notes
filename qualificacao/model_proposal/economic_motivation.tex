Achdou~\cite{achdou2014partial} examines partial differential equation (PDE) models within economics, particularly focusing on Mean Field Games (MFG) models applied to heterogeneous agents in macroeconomics.
Various scenarios are modelled, including income shocks, power law dynamics, and the impact of experimentation and knowledge diffusion on economic growth. 
In \cite{achdou2022income} a continuous time version of the Aiyagari–Bewley–Huggett model is proposed and analyzed, providing an analytical characterization of saving behaviour of the poor and closed form solutions for the wealth distribution.
A MFG model of an economy where agents engage in either goods production or the pursuit of productivity-enhancing ideas through interaction is presented in~\cite{lucas2014knowledge}. This model highlights the role of knowledge diffusion in economic dynamics.
Finally, \cite{lucas1988mechanics} proposes a model analyzing economic growth while considering the effects of human capital accumulation, offering insights into the mechanics of long-term economic development.
