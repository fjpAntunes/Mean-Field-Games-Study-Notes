We propose a game theoretical model for time allocation between work and education.
The model is based on Lucas's human capital growth model \cite{lucas1988mechanics} and Aiyagariâ€™s growth model \cite{achdou2014partial,carmona2018probabilistic}.
\textcolor{red}{Add paragraph about lucas model and paragraph about aiyagari's model.}
The agents interactions are mediated through the interest rate and wage rate of the economy, which depend on aggregated quantities of the agent's states.

\textcolor{red}{Elaborate on the justification for the interest rate and the wage rate.
Explain skill level/wage rate}

Some expected results of this research are qualitative properties and numerical solutions of the mean field limit of the game. \textcolor{red}{develop goals}
