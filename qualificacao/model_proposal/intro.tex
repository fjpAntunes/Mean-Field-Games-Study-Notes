We propose a game theoretical model for time allocation between work and education.
The model is based on Lucas's human capital growth model~\cite{lucas1988mechanics} and Aiyagariâ€™s growth model~\cite{achdou2022income,carmona2018probabilistic}.
The agents interactions are mediated through the interest rate and wage rate of the economy, which depend on aggregated quantities of the agent's states.
A key difference between the model proposed here and in~\cite{lucas1988mechanics} is heterogeneity of the agents in the model.
Some expected results of this research are qualitative properties and numerical solutions of the mean field limit of the game.
