We have reviewed mean field game theory and proposed a model of the effects of preferences for eduction in the economy.

Our next steps include simulating the full model using finite difference methods and machine learning based methods, deriving analytical results for the model, and proposing modifications to this baseline model. One such modification is to consider a principal agent mean field control problem: we could consider the scenario of a decision maker optimizing a public policy with a associated utility over the population distribution state.
