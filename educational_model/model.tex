\begin{itemize}
    \item Microeconomic Variables: Agents hold an ammount of consumer goods $a_t:\mathbb{R} \mapsto [0,\infty)$ and have an educational level $e_t: \mathbb{R} \mapsto [0,1]$. 
    Agents are distributed on the state space according to probability density $\rho$, $\int \rho(a_t, e_t, t) da\, de = 1$.
    \item Microeconomic Dynamics: The agents' time evolution on the state space is governed by the system of ODEs:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
            \dot a_t = w(\rho, e_t)\alpha - c \\
            \dot e_t = g(e_t)\beta \\
            \alpha, \beta \in [0,1], \alpha + \beta \leq 1
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}

    Agents control $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which represent the effort invested into working or raising their educational level, respectively. $w(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the wage function,
    a macroeconomic variable. The function $g(e)$ is an educational growth function, which captures an increase in the difficulty of raising educational capital. We set  
    $g(e) = e(1-e)$.
    \item Macroeconomic Variables: The wage function is a macroeconomic variable, which represents the increase in production gained with an increase in educational level.
    We set $w(\rho, e_t) = (e_t - m_{e_t}) + w_0$, where $w_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and $m_{e_t} = \mathbb{E}_\rho [e_t]$.
    \item value function: Agents optimize discounted future utility of consumer goods $u(a)$ versus discounted future effort:
    \begin{equation}
        v(a,e,t) = \sup_{\alpha_t, \beta_t} \int_t^\infty e^{- \gamma (s - t)} \left( - \alpha_s^2 - \beta_s^2 + u(a)) \right) ds
    \end{equation}
    where $u(a)$ is some concave utility function, for example $u(a) = \log(a)$.

    If $V$ is regular enough, $V$ satisfies 
    \[
        V_t - \gamma V + H(a,e,V_a, V_e) = 0,
    \]
    where $H$ is given by
    $H(a,e,q_a, q_e) = \sup_{\alpha, \beta} \left( q_a {\dot a} + q_e {\dot e}  - \alpha^2 - \beta^2 + u(a) \right)$.
    Controls $\alpha, \beta$ are given in feedback form by 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
            H_{q_a} = w(\rho, e) \alpha^* - c,\\
            H_{q_e} = g(e) \beta^*.
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    \item Time evolution of population density: The population density $\rho$ evolves according to the transport equation:
    \begin{equation}
        \rho_t + ( H_{q_a} \rho )_a + (H_{q_e} \rho)_e = 0.
    \end{equation}   
\end{itemize}
